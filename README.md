### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm LeXonJe - a student who enjoys programming.
My first ever written code was a Python program that manages the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi 1 B+.
Then I hopped over to Java which I used as a topic in an essay.
Now I'm currently learning JavaScript for making front-end stuff.

Yeah. Well, that's all I have to say for now. I hope you got a brief understanding about me.
Bye.
